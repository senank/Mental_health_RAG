<h1>Mental Health Companion: A RAG-Based Application</h1>

This project leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to generate responses based on relevant data retrieved from a MongoDB Atlas database. The data is indexed using vector embeddings generated by the Hugging Face Sentence Transformer model "all-MiniLM-L6-v2". When provided with a user prompt, the application indexes the database for relevant documents, refines the prompt based on this data, and passes it to the open-source LLM (LLaMA) to generate contextually rich responses.
